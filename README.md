# About
Term2D is a physics and game engine made for creating games or simulating physics in the terminal.
It is written completely in Java. This project is still early in development.

# Milestones
- [ ] Simulate elastic collisions and normal collisions
- [ ] Physics simulation for individual bodies
- [ ] Mass and density for shapes
- [ ] Keep track of all bodies/pixels in the display
- [ ] More shapes
- [ ] Efficient   

These are not selling points but are rather milestones for what the project hopes to accomplish.
