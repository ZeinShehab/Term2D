# About
Term2D is a physics and game engine made for creating games or simulating physics in the terminal.
It is written completely in Java. This project is still early in development. It might go more towards physics engine
or more towards game engine, maybe even both who knows?

# Milestones
- [ ] Simulate elastic collisions and normal collisions
- [ ] Physics simulation for individual bodies
- [ ] Mass and density for shapes
- [ ] Keep track of all bodies/pixels in the display
- [ ] Read keyboard input (possibly mouse)
- [ ] More shapes
- [ ] Efficient   

These are not selling points but are rather milestones for what the project hopes to accomplish.
